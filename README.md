2048 Game
The 2048 game is a simple yet addictive single-player puzzle game that has taken the internet by storm. It's a great way to challenge yourself mentally and improve your strategic thinking.
How to Play 2048?
The game is played on a 4x4 grid filled with numbered tiles. Your goal is to combine these tiles to create a tile with the number 2048 (although you can keep playing for a higher score after that).
Game Rules
Game Grid: The game is played on a 4x4 grid, where each cell contains a tile with a number. The numbers are usually powers of 2, starting from 2.
Initial Tiles: At the beginning of the game, two tiles with the number 2 or 4 are randomly placed on the grid.
Tile Movement: You can move the tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right. All the tiles on the grid will move in the selected direction until they encounter the edge of the grid or another tile.
Tile Combination: When two tiles with the same number collide while moving in a chosen direction, they will merge into a single tile with the sum of their values. For example, if two tiles with the number 2 collide, they will merge into a single tile with the number 4.
Adding New Tiles: After each move, a new tile with the value of either 2 or 4 is added to the grid in a random empty cell.
Game Goal: The primary goal is to combine tiles to reach the 2048 tile. However, the game can continue beyond 2048, and the ultimate objective is to achieve the highest score possible.
